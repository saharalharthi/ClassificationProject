## Predicting qualified employees for promotion using Classification Models


## Problem statement:
The success or failure of a company often depends on the competence of its employees, so CEOs and managers who want to succeed for their organizations face the difficult task of determining who is qualified and who is not qualified for promotion due to the lack of a data collection system to evaluate the performance of employees or the lack and weakness of the system in place. The use of some subjective elements of evaluation. Lack of interest in the planning process and good preparation for the performance appraisal process. In this project, we designed a model that helps predict qualified employees for promotion.







## Data Description:

* Features: (Employee ID,	Department,	Region, Education,	Gender,	Recruitment channel, No of trainings,	Age,	Previous year rating,	Length of service,	Awards won,	Avrege training score)
* Target: (Is promoted)
* Rows: 54808 rows.
* Data size: 13*50000
* Data type: text, integer.





## Tools:

* Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook
 
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplot, and sklearn.



## MVP Goal:
